And our first week of football is in the books! Let's break down what happened:

### R.I.P. David Johnson
This one just sucks. There's nothing worse than losing the best player in fantasy football for nearly the whole season to injury on the very first week. I took Johnson with the 2nd overall pick and I'm just devastated. I hope he gets well soon.

### Add Carson Wentz
If you read my draft strategies, you know I'm big on this kid. He's poised to have a great fantasy year, and he proved it with a strong Week 1 performance. Get him while you still can.

### Add Chris Thompson
Chris Thompson had a solid Week 1 performance including an absolute beast-mode run that would make Marshawn Lynch proud. With other Redskins running-back Rob Kelley sustaining an injury this week and Kirk Cousins and the passing attack looking rather pedestrian, I like Chris Thompson's chances of gashing his easy upcoming defenses for solid points.

### Add Adam Thielen
Thielen had a decent season last year, and many have predicted him to breakout this year. Well, he's broken out so far. The dude is a receptions and yardage machine for the dynamic Vikings' offense. With Stefon Diggs using his speed to stretch the defense deep, it's giving Thielen a bunch of oppurtunities under the coverage. Add him if he's available in your league
