And our second week of football is in the books! Let's break down what happened:

### Trade Away Mike Gillislee
This week, we saw the Patriots' notorious committee running attack return to true form, with 3 different running-backs scoring over 10 fantasy points. That's pretty insane. And that also spells some bad news for Gillislee's short-lived time as a bell-cow back. Try to trade him away while he's still hot, before his point totals get swallowed by the committee fully. Aim for a consistent flex starter.

### Add Chris Hogan
Speaking of the Patriots, you can say that they have a "receiver committee" too, but it doesn't matter becaue Tom Brady is the G.O.A.T. and he gets the ball to everyone. One of those people is Chris Hogan, the former nobody who burst onto the scene in the AFC Championship Game when he murdered the Steelers for something like 200 yards and 2 touchdowns. He was a deep sleeper prospect for a breakout season this year, and his solid performance this week makes me optimistic. He's still widely available, so pick him up if you can.

### Add Trevor Siemian
Wow. I never thought I'd say that one, but Siemian's been playing with something to prove lately. The former seventh round draft pick has put up 22 points two weeks in a row, and against respectable defenses too. It looks like he and Carson Wentz may be the breakout QBs of the year thus far. If you're in need of a QB, go for Siemian, because well, why not?
