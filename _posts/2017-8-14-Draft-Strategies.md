title: Draft Stategies 2017

Welcome to another year of fantasy football! Let's get right to it with this year's draft strategies:

### Rookie Runners
This is my biggest piece of advice for the year. A lot of people will be sleeping on them, but this is the year of rookie running-backs. The talent of these first-year prospects is unprecedented as a draft class, and a lot of them are going into some pretty great offensive schemes.

Even in the late first round or early second round, don't be afraid to take **Leonard Fournette**, the Jaguar's new bell-cow runner. He's poised for a ton of carries behind a solid offensive line, and I see him coming close to the Ezekiel Elliot's sensational rookie season from a year ago.

In the early to middle rounds, look out for **Kareem Hunt** and **Dalvin Cook**. I'm optimistic about _Kareem Hunt_, even more so now that Chief first-string runner Spencer Ware is out for the season. I think Hunt will get the starting nod over fellow backup Charcandrick West, and I see his versatility as both a runner and receiver making him a solid RB2 down the stretch of the season. I'm big on _Dalvin Cook_ as well. I understand that the Vikings have insane depth at the running back position, with both Latavius Murray and Jerrick McKinnon as backups, but I don't see this offense turning into a committee. Cook has been dominating carries in the preseason and absolutely trucking through defenses, and I expect that to continue through the season.

In the later rounds, try to snag **Joe Mixon** or **Christian McCaffrey**. Despite their talent, I'm cautious about these guys because of their offenses——they're both in committees. I love _McCaffrey_ as a player but I don't see him being used as an every-down bell-cow for the Panthers; Jonathan Stewart will probably take that role. I think McCaffrey will take on a Darren Sproles type of role——a third down back who'll be catching the ball out of the backfield a lot. _Joe Mixon's_ situation is a little more confusing. For years, the Bengals have had the most unpredictable committee running attack in the league. I don't know how Mixon will fit into this. I think he might have the talent to snatch the starting job for good, but we won't know until the season starts. I'd still recommend to try and grab one of these guys, as their upside makes them interesting fantasy players. However, there's too much risk involved to draft them before the late rounds.
