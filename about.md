In the age of the internet, there is a lot of fantasy football advice out there. Too much. Hundreds of different fantasy football websites are flooded with article upon article, most of which mainly contain random opinions and useless fluff. **Fantasy Assassin** strives to solve this, by providing **one resource that quickly and effectively communicates all necessary fantasy advice**. Filled with the author's own strategies and insights, this blog gives you useful tips and tricks to help you dominate your league. On this blog, expect to see three things:
1. A post before every season recounting all major offseason changes and sharing all important draft tips and strategies,
2. Weekly posts once the season starts summarizing all major events of the week and the best waiver-wire and trade targets,
3. An end of the season roundup discussing what went well, what went wrong, and what we learned for next season.

All posts will be short and to the point, so you can quickly and easily get the advice you need. No nonsense, just fantasy football. Time to assassinate our leagues...
